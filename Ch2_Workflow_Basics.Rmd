### Exercises pg. 40

1. Why does this code not work?
Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise, in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)
```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varÄ±able
```

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

3. Press Alt-Shift-K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?
